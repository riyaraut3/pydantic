# pydantic

Pydantic is a Python library that helps us in defining and validating data models easily. When we build applications, that handle user input or data from various sources, it is important to make sure that the data is valid and consistent. If we do not do proper validation then we might get errors or unexpected behavior in our application. Pydantic makes this process easy by allowing us to define our data structure using Python classes and automatically validating the data against these structures.
